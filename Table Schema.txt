Top Appliances:
    - Hisense Deep Freezer (H170CF 142L Chest Freezer): Consumption 0.664 kwh (https://hisenseshop.co.tz/product/hisense-h170cf-142l-chest-freezer/)
    - Scanfrost Refrigerator (): Consumption 0.879kwh/24h ()
    - LG Air Conditioner (S4-Q12JA3QG 1.5HP): EER (10.26Btu/h.W) (https://www.lg.com/africa/residential-air-conditioners/lg-S4-Q12JA3QG)
        EER in Btu/h.W (Btu per hour per Watt): An EER of 10.26 Btu/h.W means that for every watt of electrical power consumed,
        the air conditioner provides 10.26 Btu of cooling per hour.
        If : 0.005 kWh is equivalent to 5 W. That means 0.005 kWh of consumed energy would produce 5 x 10.26 = 513 Btu = 285 degree celcius 


Simulator

* Check and select all appliances in the appliance table
* For each appliance, If appliance is on(True), select the last observation in the table energyusage where homeID and applianceID matches
* Insert a new observation in energyusage. homeID, applianceID, Current Datetime, EnergyConsumed, EnergyProduced, CurrentOutput
* If appliance is off(False), select the last observation in the table energyusage where homeID and applianceID matches
* Insert a new observation in energyusage. EnergyUsageID, homeID, applianceID, Datetime, EnergyConsumed, EnergyProduced, CurrentOutput

Things to note: You will insert a new observation based on the values from the last observation fetched.
If on:
    For Air Conditioner i.e appliance id 3: A steady consumption range of 0.0007(kwh) - 0.001(kWh) and current output range of 4.0 - 5.7 (degree celcius) respectively, the value of current output will be added to the previous output and be inserted as current output. 
    For Freezer i.e appliance 1: A steady consumption 0.6(kWh) - 0.8(kWh) and current output range 2.0 - 4.7 (degree celcius) respectively, the value of current output will be added to the previous output and be inserted as current output.
    For Refrigerator i.e appliance 2: A steady consumption 0.02(kWh) - 0.04(kWh) and current output range 5.0 - 6.0 (degree celcius) respectively, the value of current output will be added to the previous output and be inserted as current output.
If off:
    For Air Conditioner i.e appliance id 3: A steady consumption range of 0(kwh) - 0(kWh) and current output range of 4.0 - 5.7 (degree celcius) respectively, the value of current output will be deducted from the previous output and be inserted as current output. 
    For Freezer i.e appliance 1: A steady consumption 0(kWh) - 0(kWh) and current output range 2.0 - 4.7 (degree celcius) respectively, the value of current output will be deducted from the previous output and be inserted as current output.
    For Refrigerator i.e appliance 2: A steady consumption 0(kWh) - 0(kWh) and current output range 5.0 - 6.0 (degree celcius) respectively, the value of current output will be deducted from the previous output and be inserted as current output.

Energy produced should be the sum of all energy consumed across all devices for each hour for a specific home.
